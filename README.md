# Flocking Algorith
In this project we used the Monogame framework to create a simulation of the flocking behavior of birds based on Craig Reynold's Boids program. Testing was done using MSTest

A bird modifies its position and velocity based on the behaviour of the birds near by.
We also added a predator bird (raven) that chases the flock of birds (sparrows).
